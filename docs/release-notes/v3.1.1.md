## 🚀 Highlights

| Category | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Performance** | 🔄 **30 % faster startup** and smoother screen transitions thanks to incremental SQLite warm-up & React Native 0.73.4 upgrade. |
| **Analytics** | 📊 New **Weekly Cash-Flow Graph** and **AI-Generated Insights** now support multi-currency data sets & dark-mode themed colours. |
| **Security** | 🔒 **Biometric fallback chain**: if Face ID fails three times, the app automatically falls back to PIN to avoid lock-outs. |
| **Exports** | 📑 **XLSX & CSV exports** now include split-transaction rows and richer metadata (category, account colour, emoji icon). |
| **UX** | ✨ **Carousel redesign** on the About page, smoother page-swipe physics in Transactions, finely-tuned haptic feedback across key actions. |

## 🆕 New Features

1. **Smart Budget Alerts**  
   Receive automatic push notifications when spending approaches custom weekly or monthly limits. Notifications are scheduled *locally*, so they work 100 % offline.
2. **AI Transaction Label Suggestions**  
   The on-device AI model (≈2 MB) analyses recent payees and auto-suggests category & emoji combinations to speed up data entry.
3. **Drag-and-Drop Re-ordering for Accounts**  
   Long-press an account card on the Home screen to rearrange order and prioritise frequently used accounts.
4. **Quick-Add Widget (Android & iOS)**  
   Log expenses directly from your home screen without fully opening the app. Configurable quick actions and automatic dark-mode adaptation.

## 🔧 Improvements

* **Database Vacuum Routine** – a weekly, low-priority task reclaims unused SQLite pages, reducing storage footprint by up to 25 % on long-term installs.
* **Multi-Currency Support** – currency formatter now respects device locale while allowing manual override per account.
* **Accessibility** – VoiceOver & TalkBack improvements, larger tap-targets and descriptive labels on charts.
* **Animations** – upgraded to Reanimated 3, lowering jank on low-end hardware.
* **Export Engine** – PDF report generator upgraded to pdf-kit 1.3.2 with better font embedding and selectable text.

---

## 🐛 Bug Fixes

* **Transaction Split UI** would sometimes lose focus when the keyboard closed – *fixed*.
* **Recurring Debts** not appearing in the Upcoming tab if created between 23:00-24:00 – *fixed*.
* **Notification Quiet Hours** could overlap across daylight-saving changes – *fixed*.
* **Negative Balances** now render correctly in the Quick Stats component (no truncation).
* **Biometric Flow** no longer displays duplicate dialogs on very fast Face ID successes.

---

## ⚠️ Breaking/Behavioural Changes

* **Theme API** – Deprecates `useThemeContext().colors.accentSecondary`. Use `accentLight` and `accentDark` for adaptive shades.
* **Secure Storage** – Migrated encryption key alias to `financaar_key_prod`. On first launch the key is rotated automatically; no user action required.
