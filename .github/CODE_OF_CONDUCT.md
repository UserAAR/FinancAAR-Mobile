# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

> **Note:** This Code of Conduct is based on the [Contributor Covenant, version 2.1](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/). We've adapted it to reflect the values and processes of the FinancAAR project.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a **harassment-free experience for everyone**, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an **open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community**.

## Our Standards

Examples of behaviour that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences.
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback.
* Taking responsibility and apologising to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience.
* Focusing on what is best for the community and project.

Examples of unacceptable behaviour include:

* The use of sexualised language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
* Public or private harassment.
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission.
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for **clarifying and enforcing** our standards of acceptable behaviour and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behaviour they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to **remove, edit, or reject** comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies **within all project spaces**, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behaviour may be reported to the project maintainers responsible for enforcement at **conduct@financaar.app**. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All project maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these **Community Impact Guidelines** in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

| Impact | Consequence |
| ------ | ----------- |
| 1. **Minor**<br/>Use of inappropriate language or other behaviour deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community | *Private, written warning* from maintainers, with clear reason and how to improve. |
| 2. **Moderate**<br/>A violation after warning or a single, more serious incident | *Temporary ban* from interaction in project spaces and need to demonstrate understanding before rejoining. |
| 3. **Serious**<br/>Continuing behaviour or violation of the guidelines in a dangerous context | *Permanent expulsion* from any community interaction. |
